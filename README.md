## Problem Description
The task that we decided to focus on is the general workings of a gym franchise, MaxFitness. The model is centered on the Gym entity. This represents each physical gym location the company owns and operates. The gym includes different equipment, classes, and physical therapy sessions that it offers to its members. We want to accurately model these relationships and create data for the model, to populate the entities and attributes of our gym. Through the use of the data model, the gym can now be more efficient in creating new business plans to favor certain consumer trends, keeping track of members and membership types, and displaying relationships between different entities of the gym.

## Data Model and Explanation
Explanation of the Data Model:

Our Data Model is based on our concept of the MaxFitness franchise and the data they would likely want to store. To begin, the Gym entity is the central entity in our data model from which all other entities originate. The Gym has a primary key (gymID), attributes (gymName, gymAddress, gymPhoneNumber), and a foreign key (managerID). In this example, a gym has only one manager, which is represented by a 1-to-1 relationship with the Employee Entity. Additionally, each gym will employ many employees, but an employee will only work for one gym, which is represented by a 1-to-many relationship between the Gym and Employee entities. Regarding the Employee entity itself, it contains information about each employee including their name, position type, address, and phone number.

The Employee entity is then connected to the Classes entity on a 1-to-many relationship because, in this example, an employee may teach many classes, but a class may only be taught by one employee. Regarding the Classes entity, it contains information on specific instances of a class and contains information on the class type (Cycling, Yoga, Kickboxing, etc.), the class capacity, and the scheduled class date. Then, the Classes entity is connected to the Members entity through a many-to-many relationship because a class can have many members and a member can register for many classes. This is represented by an associative entity named ClassRegistration which contains the registration date, along with both the memberID and classID as foreign keys. 

Backtracking a little bit now, the Employee entity is also connected to the PTSessions (PT = Personal Training) entity on a 1-to-many relationship because an employee can teach many personal training sessions, but a personal training session can only be taught by one employee. Similar to the Classes entity, the PTSessions entity contains information on the PT Type, PT description, and session scheduled date, and it records individual instances of a PT Session. Then, the PTSessions entity is connected to the PTRegistration entity on a 1-to-1 relationship because a PT session can only be registered for 1 time. The PTRegistration entity is then connected to the Members entity on a 1-to-many relationship because a member may register for multiple PTSessions, but a registration can only apply to one member. Additionally, regarding the PTRegistration entity, it contains the registration date, along with the member ID and PT session ID as foreign keys.

Next, the Member entity contains information on each of our members including their names, phone numbers, and addresses. The Member entity is connected to the Gym entity on a 1-to-many relationship because a gym can have many members, but a member can belong to only one gym (in this hypothetical). Additionally, the Member entity is connected to the Membership entity on a 1-to-many relationship because a specific membership can apply to many members, but a member can only have one membership. To clarify, the Membership entity contains information about our different membership types (gold, silver, bronze, etc.) along with their prices and benefits included. 

All members also make payments. This is represented by a 1-to-many relationship between the Member and Payment entities because a member can make multiple payments, but a payment can only apply to one member. The Payment entity contains information on the payment amount, date, and method.

Circling back to the Gym entity, every gym has pieces of equipment. This fact is represented by a 1-to-many relationship between the Gym and Equipment entities because a gym can have many pieces of equipment, but a piece of equipment can only belong to one gym. The Equipment entity itself contains information about each individual piece of equipment (identified by their PKs) including its name (treadmill, bench press, etc.), type (cardio, weight-training), date it was bought, and condition. 

Finally, the Equipment entity is connected to the MaintenanceRequest entity on a 1-to-many relationship because a piece of equipment can have many maintenance requests associated with it, but a maintenance request can only apply to one piece of equipment. We also decided to make this an identifying relationship because a maintenance request should not exist if a piece of equipment is not associated with it.

## Queries
### Query 1
Query 1 lists the names of gyms that have less than four employees
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e908fc7-2c75-4af6-afbd-29773d11c438)
Description: In order for gyms to be able to meet the demand of its members, we need each gym to have at least four employees. This query lists the number of gyms that don't so that we know which gyms need to hire more employees so that no gym is overwhlemed.
### Query 2
Query 2 lists the Total Members and Total Equipment at each Gym that has more members than pieces of equipment

Description: It's important for a gym to have more pieces of equipment than members so that members are not having to stand around and wait for equipment to become available. This query outputs the gyms that we need to add more pieces of equipment to so that we accommodate the number of members there.
### Query 3
Query 3 lists the employee first name, employee last name and count of classIDs for the Employees at our gyms that are teaching three or more classes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2d84bfe-7579-40dc-bcfe-d794448c7852)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/773a4ed5-fc43-4066-b196-01d69b78f041)
Description: A gym wants to promote it's classes to maximize revenue and member satisfaction. We would like to promote our classes to members not currently enrolled in any classes so this query will help give us a list of members we can market our advertising towards.

### Query 5
Query 5 lists the average payment amount for each gym
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0d15219-49e5-4c7a-9278-3c95def424e5)                                                                         
Description: A gym wants to keep track of how much members are spending of memberships at each gym on average. This query gives us that result so that we can advertise at gyms with lower averages to maximize profits. It can also tell us which gyms members perfer to pay a premium at and which ones members choose the basic membership.
### Query 6
Query 6 lists the day of the week and the total number of members regsistered for the class where the class category is "yoga"
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f20d0cb8-bcf7-4d94-90e3-f95cfe286950)
Description: A gym wants see what day of the week it should add another yoga class for based on how many members are already registered for yoga class. A gym doesn't need to add another class on a Tuesday if Tuesdays are not popular among yoga class enrollees. This query gives us the total number of members registered by day of the week so that we can make an informed decesion about what day of the week the next yoga class should be taught on.
